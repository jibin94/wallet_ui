# Wallet UI
Wallet app UI showcases a clean and interactive user interface for wallet management. It includes features like user sign-in, navigation drawer and home page.
Uses the `ThemeManager` to toggle between light and dark themes. Sets up the `Material App` with themeMode as `ThemeMode.system` to switch between light and dark modes based on system settings.
